This repository demonstrates a common error encountered in Rust programming: the mutable borrow error.  The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to create multiple mutable references to the same variable, resulting in a compile-time error. The `bugSolution.rs` file demonstrates a correct approach that avoids this error.  Understanding and avoiding mutable borrow errors is crucial for writing safe and efficient Rust code.
